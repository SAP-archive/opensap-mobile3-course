Android Exercises for the [2019 openSAP Mobile course](https://open.sap.com/courses/mobile3).

### Evolved Web Apps with SAPUI5 (ui52)

Welcome to your learning journey to develop mobile apps with SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services. This repository contains the code for week 5 of the openSAP course *Build Mobile Applications with SAP Cloud Platform Mobile Services* (mobile3).
Please follow the setup instructions below to get started.

## Directions

This repository contains an Android project which is the result of the exercises in Week 5 of the aforementioned openSAP course. In the `master` branch, you will find the final result of the exercises. Additionally, there are tagged commits which allow you to jump to the end of individual exercises. Use them to skip forward if you face issues or if you want to reset to the beginning of an exercise:

* `git checkout exercise-2-start`
* `git checkout exercise-3-start` takes you to the solution of exercise 2 - a basic step counter app - which is also the start of exercise 3.
* `git checkout exercise-4-start` takes you to the solution of exercise 3 - adding OData Offline capabilities - which is also the start of exercise 4.
* `git checkout exercise-5-start` takes you to the solution of exercise 4 - adding Logging  - which is also the start of exercise 5.
* `git checkout master` takes you to the final app, which includes the solution of exercise 5 - adding Usage Analytics capabilities.

Please note that checking out different versions may not work if you modify tracked files. You can run `git stash` to stash them, which allows you to bring them back later.

As an alternative to working with Git branches, you can also download the corresponding ZIP in the [Releases tab](../../releases).
